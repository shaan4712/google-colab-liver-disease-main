The normal ranges for various liver function tests can vary slightly depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used for testing.

# Normal Person Data Set:

1. General Bilirubin Level: 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL
2. Direct Bilirubin Level: 0.0 to 0.3 mg/dL
3. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 20 to 140 U/L
4. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT): 7 to 56 U/L
5. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST or SGOT): 10 to 40 U/L
6. Total Proteins: 6.0 to 8.3 g/dL
7. Albumin: 3.5 to 5.0 g/dL
8. Albumin and Globulin Ratio: Approximately 1.2 to 2.0

# Person Suffering from Liver Disease Data Set:

1. General Bilirubin Level: >1.0 mg/dL (elevated)
2. Direct Bilirubin Level: >0.3 mg/dL (elevated)
3. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Can vary significantly based on the type and severity of liver disease; usually elevated compared to normal range
4. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT): Can vary significantly; often elevated in liver disease
5. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST or SGOT): Can vary significantly; often elevated in liver disease
6. Total Proteins: Can vary based on the specific condition; may be decreased in advanced liver disease
7. Albumin: Can be decreased in advanced liver disease
8. Albumin and Globulin Ratio: Can be altered in liver disease, often decreased compared to normal range

**_Note that these ranges are general guidelines and may not apply to every individual or every specific liver condition. Liver function tests should be interpreted in conjunction with a thorough clinical assessment and other diagnostic tests by a healthcare provider._**
